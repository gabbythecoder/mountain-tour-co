# Website Build Assignment 

Week 1 assignment - Build out the Website.

Created a fictional website titled Mountain Tour Co. as part of the Tech Educators course.

Website built on VSCode using HTML and CSS. The content of the website (i.e. tour section, about us section) were generated by AI.

I have managed to complete all the requirements needed for this assignment:
* Each section on the webpage is wrapped in correct semantic tags. I have included a header with a nav bar, a main section and a footer.
* I have used CSS absolute positioning to overlay text on an image. I used this in the home content section, which you can see on the bottom right of the background image. 
* I used flexbox throughout the website to create a responsive layout. 
* All image elements are implemented correctly with the right file path. 

After completing the requirements, I did want to challenge myself and take on the stretch requirements: 
* A back-to-top button was created to bring the website to the top.
* I have added smooth scroll behaviour to improve user experience.
* Hover effects was added on the nav bar, 'Book Now' button, social media icons that is located in the footer and the back-to-top button.
* I added social media icons that are linked to social media pages when clicked in the footer of the website.
* Background music has been added and it will autoplay when the website loads. 

During the website build process, I did encounter some difficulties, especially when using flexbox in the tour section and adding the back-to-top button. With the tour section, the layout I planned was to have the section centered but it initially was placed more to the left. After numerous attempts of changing up the codes, I realised I needed an extra div element which fixed my issue. With the back-to-top button, it initially did not show up but when I was added a background colour, the arrow was white, which is why I was not able to see it initially. 

After many trial and errors, the website is completed. When I needed assistance, I reached out 
to my fellow bootcampers, who were really helpful. YouTube and Google were also a lifesaver. 

I have linked the websites and YouTube tutorials that I found helpful during this assignment:
